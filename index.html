        <h1>Coursera: My First Project</h1> "This is Thelina's header"
        <p>This is a painful learning experience. This instructor is unqualified, and has negatively impacted Coursera's credibility. However, Thelina also makes me realize that I could probably sign up as a Coursera instructor and make some money. If she's this bad and is making money, I could most likely make some passive income because I guarantee that I can read, comprehend and pronounce everyday and software-industry specific words in a script. For example, I know the difference between double quotes and parentheses!</p> "This woman has no clue! I can't believe I paid for her class."
